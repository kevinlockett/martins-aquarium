Martin's Aquairium Was the first project Cohort 52 undertook at Nashville Software Shool (NSS).

This whimsical project followed the storyline of Martin, an avid fish collector who maintains a sophisticated tank in his home and is eager to track his inventory of fish, the exotic locations he harveted them, and provide users with tips for maintaining their own home aquariums.

It served as a means to get students set up on their Mac or Windows systems, begin using terminal, practice HTML, CSS, and an entrylevel dbase.js module.  This was our second group project -- the first being development of the "world's worst website" -- and served as a way to practice pair development and tracking code changes with Git and Github.
